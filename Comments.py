#COMMENTS STARTS WITH A #, AND pYTHON WILL IGNORE THEM.
#Comments can be used to explain python code.
#Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
#Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

# print("hello, world!!!!")  #PREVENT FROM EXECUTION
print("Cheers, Mate")


# MULTILINE COMMENTS
# Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
# To add a multiline comments you could insert a # for each line

# OR NOT QUITE AS INTENDED, YOU CAN USE A MULTILINE STRING,
"""
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable,
you can add a multiline string (Triple quotes) in your code,
and place your comment inside it:
"""
# As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the 
# code, but the ignored it, and you have made a multiline comment.
